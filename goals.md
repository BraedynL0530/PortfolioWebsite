#Goals for website

##Frontend

I wish to create a Linux / terminal type navigation from page to page that shows off my personality OR early windows desktop with each page being an application

Golang used to make a fast concurrent api for github no django core bloat
Django communicates between them all and helps with dynamic data and displaying it to web

Machine Learnkng

**Pytorch used to make a NLP pipeline

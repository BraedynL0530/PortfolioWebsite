# Goals for Website

## Frontend

I wish to create a Linux/terminal-style navigation from page to page that shows off my personality,  
or an early Windows desktop style with each page being an application.

## Backend

Golang will be used to make a fast, concurrent API for GitHub (no Django core bloat).  
Django communicates between them all and helps with dynamic data and displaying it to the web.

## Machine Learning

PyTorch will be used to create an NLP pipeline.
